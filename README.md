## Find out who owes you money for using too much data!

Are the people on your family phone plan constantly going over on their data usage?
Nobody knows how much to pay so you're stuck footing the bill month after month, right?
### Wrong!
#### Now you can use this simple tool to calculate the exact amount everyone owes for their data bill each month!
Just follow the steps below:
1. Enter the number of people on your plan
1. Enter the names of all those folks
1. Enter the amount of data each person used
1. Enter the total amount of data on your plan
1. Enter the amount you owe for overages
1. Finally stop paying for other people's data!

The calculator will **only** charge the people on your plan that used **over** the data limit
